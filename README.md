# Transition-State-and-Minimum-Energy-Path-of-Bistable-Elastic-Continua
The files are to reproduce simulations in the paper "Finding Transition State and Minimum Energy Path of Bistable Elastic Continua through Energy Landscape Explorations" by Wan et al. The simulations are carried out with MATLAB and ABAQUS. The MATLAB codes give examples of analyzing the transition state and minimum energy path of bistble elastic structures. A few ABAQUS codes, are also included to explore the reconfigruation of bistable structures in finite element simulations.
